# blood-sugar-logger
A single user blood sugar level logging web system

This is a complete single user web system I made after I was diagnosed with diabetes to log my own blood sugar level, 
the current insulin level and enter a note for each measurement if needed.

The backend is written in PHP and MySQL and the frontend in vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

To create or modify data, a secret token must be entered.

The form page contains a diagram showing the current prick spot on the finger, input fields and the latest measurements.

There is a page with a diagram showing the current insulin prick spot on the thigh.

Several aggregating graphs shows the levels over time. They have min max and mid readings. 

There is a page with complete log in table format.

You can see the site (with my personal measurements)
